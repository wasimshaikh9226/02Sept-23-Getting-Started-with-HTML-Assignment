The Document Type Declaration, commonly referred to as the DOCTYPE declaration, is an instruction or a preamble that specifies the version of HTML or XHTML being used in a web document. It helps browsers to interpret and render the content correctly by informing them about the rules and syntax to expect in the document.

The DOCTYPE declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. It is not an HTML tag itself; instead, it is a declaration that provides information to the browser about the version of HTML or XHTML and the document type definition to be used.

Here is an example of the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Head content goes here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
In this example:

<!DOCTYPE html> specifies that the document is written in HTML5. This declaration is sufficient for modern web development, as HTML5 is the latest version at the time of this response.
html is the root element of the HTML document, and lang="en" specifies the language of the document as English.
Different versions of HTML have different DOCTYPE declarations. For example, the DOCTYPE for HTML 4.01 looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
Including the correct DOCTYPE declaration is important for ensuring that browsers render the HTML document according to the intended specifications. Modern web development typically uses HTML5, and the simple <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is commonly used for this purpose.
